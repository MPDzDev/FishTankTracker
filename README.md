# üêü FishTankTracker

Static, zero-backend aquarium tracker.  
This project renders a JSON file (`aquatrack.json`) into a clean, responsive webpage (`index.html`) that shows:

- Tank details (name, volume, notes, start date)
- Residents (fish, shrimp, snails, plants)
- Measurements (pH, temp, GH, KH, NO‚ÇÉ, NO‚ÇÇ, NH‚ÇÉ, notes)
- Events (water changes, treatments, filter cleans, notes)
- Photo gallery (with optional captions, dates, resident references)

All logic is client-side. Nothing is stored or written‚Äî**display-only**.  
You update `aquatrack.json` whenever you want to log new entries.

---

## How it works

- Open [`index.html`](index.html) in a browser.
- Data is loaded from a JSON file you provide:
  - Pass it via URL:  
    ```
    index.html?data=aquatrack.json
    ```
  - Or click **Load JSON** on the page.
  - Or drag & drop a JSON file.

- If you keep photos locally in `/photos/`, add a base parameter:  
index.html?data=aquatrack.json&base=/photos/

pgsql
Copy code
Or define `"photosBase": "/photos/"` inside the JSON.

Deployment
You can host anywhere that serves static files:

GitHub Pages
Push index.html, aquatrack.json, and optional photos/ folder to this repo.

Go to repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí set branch to main.

Access at https://<yourname>.github.io/FishTankTracker/index.html?data=aquatrack.json.

Netlify / Cloudflare Pages
Link repo ‚Üí set framework = None ‚Üí publish root = repo root.

Self-hosted (Nginx/Apache)
Copy files into /var/www/fishtank/.

Serve index.html.

Workflow with Codex/ChatGPT
Keep aquatrack.json as the single source of truth.

When you log something new (‚Äúadd 24.5 ¬∞C, pH 7.2, 2025-10-06‚Äù), Codex/ChatGPT can rewrite the JSON with the new entry.

Commit and push the updated JSON to GitHub.

Reload the page‚Äînew data appears instantly.

Project goals
Stay static and minimal: no backend, no DB, no local writes.

Be easily extendable with more JSON sections (dosing, monthly summaries).

Work offline if JSON is bundled next to the HTML.
