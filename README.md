# üêü FishTankTracker

Static, zero-backend aquarium tracker.

This project renders a JSON file (`aquatrack.json`) into a clean, responsive webpage (`index.html`) that shows:

- Tank details (name, volume, notes, start date)
- Residents (fish, shrimp, snails, plants)
- Measurements (pH, temp, GH, KH, NO‚ÇÉ, NO‚ÇÇ, NH‚ÇÉ, notes)
- Events (water changes, treatments, filter cleans, notes)
- Photo gallery (with optional captions, dates, resident references)

All logic is client-side. Nothing is stored or written‚Äî**display-only**. You update `aquatrack.json` whenever you want to log new entries.

---

## How it works

1. Open [`index.html`](index.html) in a browser.
2. Load data from a JSON file by any of these methods:
   - Pass it via URL query:
     ```
     index.html?data=aquatrack.json
     ```
   - Click **Load JSON** on the page.
   - Drag & drop a JSON file onto the page.
3. If you keep photos locally in `/photos/`, add a base parameter to the URL:
   ```
   index.html?data=aquatrack.json&base=/photos/
   ```
   Or define `"photosBase": "/photos/"` inside the JSON file.

## Deployment

You can host anywhere that serves static files:

- **GitHub Pages**
  - Push `index.html`, `aquatrack.json`, and the optional `photos/` folder to this repo.
  - Go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages** and set the branch to `main`.
  - Access at `https://<yourname>.github.io/FishTankTracker/index.html?data=aquatrack.json`.
- **Netlify / Cloudflare Pages**
  - Link the repo, set the framework to **None**, and publish the repository root.
- **Self-hosted (Nginx/Apache)**
  - Copy the files into `/var/www/fishtank/`.
  - Serve `index.html`.

---

## Workflow with Codex/ChatGPT

- Keep `aquatrack.json` as the single source of truth.
- When you log something new (e.g., ‚Äúadd 24.5‚ÄØ¬∞C, pH 7.2, 2025-10-06‚Äù), Codex/ChatGPT can rewrite the JSON with the new entry.
- Commit and push the updated JSON to GitHub.
- Reload the page‚Äînew data appears instantly.

---

## Project goals

- Stay static and minimal: no backend, no database, no local writes.
- Be easily extendable with more JSON sections (dosing, monthly summaries).
- Work offline if the JSON is bundled next to the HTML.
